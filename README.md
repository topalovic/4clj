# 4Clojure solutions

Runnable solutions to [4Clojure](https://github.com/4clojure/4clojure) problems.

Note that this is a work in progress. Also, I'm too lazy to repack the "elementary" solutions.

To run the entire suite:

```
$ clj -M:test
```

and to run a single test:

```
$ clj -M:test -v foreclojure.solutions-test/solution-42
```

Have fun!
